title: WSL ROCm
description: After a few days of troubleshooting trying to get ROCm to work on WSL I noted down these instructions for future me.

I wanted to run ROCm on WSL so I could run some computer vision model training with Tensorflow which led me down a multi day rabbit hole.

1. Install WSL (I'm partial to Ubuntu Server)
2. Add these repos (might need to be changed depending on release)

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository -y -s deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy main universe
```

3. Install ROCm drivers for WSL [here](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/radeon/en/latest/docs/install/wsl/install-radeon.html)
4. Install tensorflow-rocm from [here](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/3rd-party/tensorflow-install.html#install-tensorflow-versions)

5. Either export the following or add them to your .bashrc:

```rc
HSA_ENABLE_SDMA = 0;
ROCM_PATH = /opt/cmor;
```

And it works!! Hopefully....
