title: ZFS Data Transfer
description: Some useful commands for moving Zvols or datasets across pools
---

I needed to migrate some Zvols to a different pool so I found these zfs commands.

1. Create a snapshot.

```bash
zfs snapshot poolname/zvolname@snapshot_name
# or
zfs snapshot poolname/dataset@snapshot_name
```

2. View Snapshots

```bash
zfs list -t snapshot
```

3. Copy the zvol or dataset as a snapshot to the new pool.

```bash
zfs send SourcePool/zvolname@snapshot_name | zfs recv DestPool/zvolname
# or
zfs send SourcePool/datasetname@snapshot_name | zfs recv DestPool/datasetname
```

If you want the destination's name to be different from the souce you can change the destination's name.

_**Note**: If you make chanegs to a dataset or zvol after the snapshot it won't be copied to the destination._
